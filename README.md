# High_Performance_Computing
## Overview
This repository, "High_Performance_Computing," contains the coursework and assignments from the High-Performance Computing course offered at the University of Genoa (UniGe), specifically tailored for the Master's degree in Computer Science. The repository is structured to include three primary assignments and a main project, all focusing on the parallelization of code using different technologies: OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI.

## Homeworks
### Homework 1: Parallelization with OpenMP
The first assignment involves the utilization of OpenMP to parallelize a given piece of code. OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) is an API that supports multi-platform shared memory multiprocessing programming in C and C++.

### Homework 2: Parallelization with CUDA
The second assignment shifts focus to CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), a parallel computing platform and application programming interface model created by Nvidia. This assignment involves parallelizing a different code segment using CUDA, which enables the use of Nvidia GPUs for general purpose processing (GPGPU).

### Homework 3: Parallelization with MPI
The third assignment involves the Message Passing Interface (MPI). MPI is a standardized and portable message-passing system designed to function on a wide variety of parallel computers. In this assignment, students are tasked with parallelizing code using MPI, demonstrating an understanding of distributed memory computing by using the INFN institute cluster.
